Trends observed from WeatherPy Data:
1. The temperature of the cities seemed to stay fairly consistent between latitude ranges -60 and 0.
However, latitudes 0 and over had an obvious decrease in temperature.
After this point, it appears that as the latitude increases, the temperature decreases.

2. For latitude vs. humidity, the data points were very scattered.
The latitudes with the most variations were clustered between -40 and -20, and 20 and 40.

3. For cloudiness, I did not see any kind of correlation between cloudiness and latitude.
It appears that latitude does not have any affect on cloudiness, based on the data observed.
